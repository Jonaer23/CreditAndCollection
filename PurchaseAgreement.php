It is agreed that the cemetery of the SELLER is operated as a memorial park cemetery which means that a Park Care Fund in the form of an irrevocable trust has been established in conformity with the prudent cemetery management.

                             to the end that said grounds shall remain and be reasonably cared for as a memorial park.  The  "Care" shall not include the maintenance, repair or replacement of any marble markers, grave stones, monuments or memorials; nor the maintenance or doing of any special or unusual work in the cemetery;
                             nor the construction or reconstruction of any marble, granite, bronze or concrete work on any lot where the same is damaged from any cause whatsoever.  It is distinctly understood that the SELLER have the irrevocable power to revise or cancel any existing trust and substitute it with another,
                             or establish any trust on such terms and conditions and with such trustee or trustees, that the SELLER may determine.  This fund shall not be treated as revenue of the SELLER.
